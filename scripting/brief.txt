Write a script that does the following:

    - Creates a new directory inside your home directory
    - Creates 2 .txt files
    - Moves one of the file outside the directory
    - Renames that file to test1.txt
    - Renames the second file to test2.sh
    - Make test2.sh a script that prints the working directory
    - Execute that script
Make this script executable from everywhere.
